# Core Dashboard Layout
## Navigation Bar
Non-logged-in users navbar:

- Home / Logo (left side)
- Login (right side)
- Sign Up (right side, highlighted/different color)

Logged-in users navbar:

- Home / Logo (left side)
- Dashboard
- Practice (with dropdown showing subjects: Mathematics, Computer, English, Quantitative/Logical)
- Profile (right side, maybe with dropdown: My Profile, Settings, Logout)
Sign Up (right side, highlighted/different color)

### Some instructions for the Logo:
For the Logo, the application name is "PrepUp".

## Welcome Section
Display a personalized greeting (“Welcome back, Aryan!”), sparking motivation. Include a short message supporting continued learning and improvement.

## Quick Stats (Overview Panel)
Present the most important information at the top. Show data such as:

- Number of quizzes completed.

- Accuracy and average speed.

- Weakest and strongest areas.
These stats should be easy to read, using clear fonts and a simple visual hierarchy—place the KPIs where users look first (such as the top left).

## Action Items
Feature shortcuts for the most frequently used actions:

- “Start Quiz” or “Resume Practice,” leading users straight into meaningful work.

- “Review Mistakes” (based on last attempts).
Use prominent buttons or cards, spaced so the dashboard doesn’t feel crammed.​

## Progress Tracking
Offer visual progress bars, status rings, or segmented cards for each subject (Math, Analytical Ability, Computer Awareness, General English).

Progress should show topics mastered vs. topics pending.

Use color indicators (like green for completed, orange for areas needing work) and clear labels.​

## Achievements or Milestones
Place badges, “Star Chart Discoveries,” and similar gamified elements in a secondary section. These motivate, but shouldn’t overwhelm the core dashboard.

## Practice Zones
Allow users to “dive in” from each subject card. Include clear call-to-action buttons for each zone.

## UI and Experience Best Practices
Group related information (such as all progress bars together) so users find insights faster.

Avoid unnecessary clutter; only essential features should appear on the dashboard.

Maintain visual consistency: use the same color scheme, similar card styles, and consistent fonts throughout.​

Use a grid or card layout that adapts smoothly to devices of different sizes.

Prioritize an inverted pyramid structure: the most vital info at the top, detailed breakdowns lower down.​

## Beginner’s Dashboard Description
For users who have just signed up and have not started any attempts:

The Welcome section still greets the user, possibly with guidance (“Start your first quiz now!”).

Quick Stats and Progress Tracking panels should display as empty or zeroed-out (“No quizzes completed yet,” “You haven’t started any subjects”).

Action Items focus on getting started (“Take your first quiz,” “Explore subjects”).

Milestone/achievement cards are blank or faded, inviting the user to “unlock” badges by participating.

Progress cards show motivational prompts, not bars (e.g., “Your journey begins here!”).

Dashboard should feel encouraging, uncluttered, and guide the user to their first action, perhaps with highlighted onboarding tips or a step-by-step tour.
